# Signal Processing: Application of Wavelet Transformation

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the velocity of sonic waves based on well log data. The workflow leverages signal processing and wavelet transformation methods, integrated with advanced regression models, to deliver accurate predictions for geophysical applications.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source:** Well log measurements (features such as CAL, CNC, GR, HRD, HRM, PE, ZDEN, DTC, DTS)
- **Goal:** Predict sonic wave velocities for subsurface analysis, aiding geophysical exploration and reservoir characterization.
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis with visualization  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Machine learning regression (e.g., XGBoost)  
  - Model evaluation (MSE, R²)  
  - Results visualization

## File Structure

- `Project_64_Sonic_Wave_Velocity_Predictor.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with code, analysis, and results
- `train.csv` — Training data (not included; see below)
- `test.csv` — Test data (not included; see below)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NMalik31/Signal-Processing-Wavelet-Tranformation.git
   cd Signal-Processing-Wavelet-Tranformation
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   - Python 3.x
   - [See requirements below]

   You can install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. **Download the datasets:**
   - Place your `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the appropriate directory as referenced in the notebook.

4. **Run the notebook:**
   - Open `Project_64_Sonic_Wave_Velocity_Predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells step by step.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Usage

The notebook walks through:
- Mounting Google Drive for data access (if running on Colab)
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training with XGBoost
- Evaluation and visualization of results

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
```
*(Continue following the steps in the notebook for full workflow)*

## Results

The project evaluates predictive performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score, and visualizes the regression outcomes.
